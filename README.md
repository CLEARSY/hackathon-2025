# hackathon-2025
Hackathon organized at IMD/UFRN in Natal from 21/07/2025 to 25/07/2025.

## Organization
This hackathon is organized over 5 consecutive days.
It will address B modelling and be the occasion to assess:
- modelling skills using mathematical predicates
  - specification: how to transform a text in natural language into a formal model,
  - implementation: knowledge of the B0 principles (only deterministic substitutions and implementable types),
- understanding of the whole process:
  - ability to trigger typecheck, proof obligation generation, automatic provers
  - ability to correct a model
  - understanding of what a proof obligation is and to check visualy if it is true or false.

Students can participate alone or in a group, as they wish.

Based on this report and solely on this report, a score will be given to each report. 
The author(s) of the report with the highest score will receive a new laptop, a wired mouse, and a bag.
In case of ex-aequos, additional criteria will be used in descending order: 
1) automatic rate of proof (quantitative criterion),
2) interest and usefulness of explanations (qualitative criterion).
