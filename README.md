# hackathon-2025
Hackathon organized at IMD/UFRN in Natal from 21/07/2025 to 25/07/2025.
It is aimed at using B for modelling and proving software with Atelier B and ProB.
The subjects are issued from concrete examples from real life. Their complexity is compatible with the format of the hackathon.

The first 3 students will receive respectively:
- #1 a portable PC (specs TBD),
- #2 a 1 To SDD,
- #3 a 0.5 To SDD. 

In case of excellent performance, #1 will be offered the possibility to do a 6-month internship in France.

## Organization
This hackathon is organized over 5 consecutive days.
It will address B modelling and be the occasion to assess:
- modelling skills using mathematical predicates
  - specification: how to transform a text in natural language into a formal model,
  - implementation: knowledge of the B0 principles (only deterministic substitutions and implementable types),
- understanding of the whole process:
  - ability to trigger typecheck, proof obligation generation, automatic provers
  - ability to correct a model
  - understanding of what a proof obligation is and to check visualy if it is true or false.

Students may collaborate over the differents parts of the hackathon. However reports are nominative and should be written by a 

Based on this report and solely on this report, a score will be given to each report. 
This score is used to nominate #1, #, and #3, who will receive a prize. 

## Contents
